CWD:
This is the "cuckoo working directory", it allows to precise the folder of all the configuration files. by default it is ~/.cuckoo
You can change the CWD at every execution by precising what will be the path to the configuration. "--cwd ~/.cuckoo"
there exists other manner to change the CWD precised here: https://cuckoo.sh/docs/installation/host/cwd.html

I did not configure for volatility https://cuckoo.sh/docs/installation/host/configuration.html#memory-conf not sure that is necessary for now, i would have to install it if it is the case.

For the network configuration, -> talks with AL maybe set up InetSim??

To run cuckoo in the background ant to automate the process or running cuckoo we can use. supervisor:
supervisord -c $CWD/supervisord.conf
supervisorctl stop cuckoo:
supervisorctl start cuckoo:


To clean all submitted tasks: 
cuckoo clean
