BUILD
# building an image
docker build path/to/Dockerfile -t imageName:tagname
# the directory is not mandatory neither the tagname 

IMAGES
# display all images:
docker images
# remove an image:
docker rmi imageID
# search for images:
docker search name_to_search
# allows to see all the commands that goes from the original image to the current image:
docker history imagename

RUN
# to run a container:
docker run --rm -i "repository" bash
# you can pass the "--rm" flag to automaticaly delete the container once exited
# if you add the flag "-d" it detaches the container from the terminal. "--name blabla" allows to name our container blabla and to stop it we just do: docker stop blabla
# --tty allows to attach the current terminal 
# --interactive allows to dialog with the container what we type int the terminal will be transmitted to the bash of the container
# -p <num1>:<num2> allows a port number mapping num1 is the port of the docker host and the num2 is the docker container port number.
# you can map the volume in the container to a local volume, we need to specify the 
# -v /path/in/container:/path/in/host option when launching the container
# -network=neworkName allows to attach a network to the container

CREATE
# It contains the same options as the docker run
docker create ...

OTHERS:
# attach a container without exiting the container:
nsenter -m -u -n -p -i -t containerID command
# the command is of the type "/bin/bash" without the quotes
# to inspect a container OR an image OR a network: (return low-level information)
docker inspect containerID/imageName:
# to see the docker storage driver being used:
docker info
# listing all the volume
docker volume ls

NETWORK:
# listing all docker networks
docker network ls
# to inspect a network:
docker network inspect networkName
# creating a network: drivername = name used for the network driver and name = name given to the network
docker network create --driver driverName name

CONTAINER:
docker stats containerID
docker attach containerID
docker pause containerID
docker unpause containerID
docker kill containerID
# allows to see the diff between an image and the container
docker diff container_id
# display all containers:
docker ps -a
# display containers currently running:
docker ps
# is the same as
docker container ls
# remove a container:
docker rm containerName
# remove all containers exited:
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)
# to see the logs
docker logs containerID


DOCKER:
sudo service docker start
sudo service docker stop
